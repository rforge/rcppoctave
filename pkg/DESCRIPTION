Description: Direct interface to Octave. The primary goal is to facilitate the
    port of Matlab/Octave scripts to R. The package enables to call any Octave
    functions from R and as well as browsing their documentation, passing
    variables between R and Octave, using R core RNGs in Octave, which ensures
    that stochastic computations are also reproducible.
