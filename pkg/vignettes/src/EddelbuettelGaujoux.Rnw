\section{Introduction}

Octave \cite{Eaton2008} is a high-level interactive language which is primarily intended for numeri- cal computations. 
As it is mostly compatible with Matlab \cite{MATLAB2010}, it has found widespread adoption across different disciplines.
While Matlab has historically been pre-eminent in domains such as electrical engineering and signal processing, it is also widely used in other fields such as bioinformatics or finance. 
Consequently, a large corpus of application programs are available as .m-files (named after the commonly-chose file extension).
R \cite{R}, a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics, has become the dominant language for statistical research, and a widely-used environment for empirical work in a variety of fields.
While both languages share commonalities, their respective focus is different making a combination of both environments an even more compelling choice.
This short paper illustrates the RcppOctave package by \cite{RcppOctave} which implements an interface between both these environments.
