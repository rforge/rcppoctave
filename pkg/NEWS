    o Octave functions' stderr output is now buffered by default, so 
    that it does not bypass R own i/o functions.
    All messages/warnings sent to stderr from Octave are displayed on 
    exiting the function call.
    o function .CallOctave gains a new argument buffer_stderr to disable stderr 
    buffering (see above).
    o Octave startup warnings (e.g. shadowing of core functions by Octave modules) 
    are not shown anymore.
    o Minor adaptations to pass new CRAN checks

    o Conditional use of function packageName: use the one from pkgmaker 
    in R <= 2.15.3, or the one exported by utils in R >= 3.0.
