# Installation on Windows

You will need to have:

  * Rtools: the package contains C++ source files that need to be
  compiled, which means that Rtools needs to be installed, with its
  bin/ sub-directory in the system PATH.
  
  See http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/ for how to install the
  version of Rtools compatible with your R version;
  
  * Octave: development was performed using the mingw version of
  Octave, which can be installed as decribed in the Octave wiki:

    http://wiki.octave.org/Octave_for_Windows#Octave-3.6.4-mingw_.2B_octaveforge_pkgs

  Octave binary bin/ sub-directory (e.g.,C:\Octave\Octave3.6.4\gcc4.6.2\bin}) must be 
  in the system PATH as well, preferably after Rtools own bin/ sub-directory.

  
# Installation on Mac OS

Support for Mac OS is not yet official, but is currently being investigating.
Preliminary discussion(s) on how to install and run under Mac can be found here:

http://lists.r-forge.r-project.org/pipermail/rcppoctave-user/2013-October/000024.html

The installation procedure under investigation is based on the Octave version
provided by homebrew (http://brew.sh/):

  1. install XCode and its Command Line Tools
  2. install homebrew
  3. add the homebrew/science repository (tap in brewing language):

    $ brew tap homebrew/science
    $ brew update && brew upgrade
    $ brew tap --repair #may not be necessary
    $ brew install gfortran
    $ brew install octave
